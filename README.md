# TitanicClassificationProjectGoogleBangkit2021

This project is part of lessons that I got from Google Bangkit 2021 as a practice for Classification lessons that I learned before.
In the code you can see I do a few things as follows:
1. Do a simple Exploratory Data Analysis before feeding the data to the model
2. Build Neural Network Model with Tensorflow
3. Do evaluation
4. Iterate with another model, in this project I use Decision Tree Regressor and Logistic Regressor from sci-kit learn library
